# libscopehp
An interface wrapper library for possibly various pieces of measurement gear, but currently only the HP54645D/Agilent 54645D/Keysight 54645D.

This is designed to be a wrapper for measurement gear, since the original libraries by HP are a pain to work with, and I wanted something in a modern language with inline documentation.
